After this it will have to work narratively with DM approval after this. I'm not opposed to character changes but I'd like to avoid destabilizing the party in the process. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/equipment\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/equipment\" target=\"_self\">Starting Gold and Equipment – D&amp;D Basic Rules</a>Should a new character need to join us in the middle of the campaign, we will most likely start that character at current player character levels unless the narrative and player/dm agree otherwise.This campaign uses standard D&amp;D 5e rules for falling unconscious and death saving throws.Character death is a real possibility. Choices matter, combat can be dangerous, and caution is sometimes the wiser path. Without meaningful consequences, there is no reason to be careful.Resurrection magic exists in the world but follows normal rules. Time limits apply, required spells must be available, and material costs are in line with published rules. Not every death will be easily reversible, and resurrection is never guaranteed to be immediate or convenient.If a character dies, we will handle it respectfully and collaboratively. Options may include resurrection if circumstances allow, introducing a new character, or weaving the loss into the story in a meaningful way.The goal is not to punish players, but to ensure tension, stakes, and emotional weight remain part of the game.Experience will be done through Milestones, I.E. when the DM says you level up... we level your characters up. This will typically be done at the tail end of a session so anyone who needs help doing so may stay after and get the help they need. We will use the optional flanking rules in combat.When two allies are positioned on opposite sides of a creature and both can attack it, they gain advantage on melee attacks against that creature. This applies equally to player characters and enemies.Positioning and movement matter. Enemies will use flanking when it makes sense, just as players can.<br>When leveling players will have the choice to either take the default HP increase or roll their hit points at the table (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player/Rules/Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e\" data-href=\"Player/Rules/Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e\" href=\"player/rules/hit-point-increases-in-d&amp;d-5e.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e</a>), should you roll a 1 you may re-roll once per level. <br>Choose your <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player/Rules/Alignment\" data-href=\"Player/Rules/Alignment\" href=\"player/rules/alignment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alignment</a> carefully, I'd like to use these as a guide for how your character will react in situations<br>Racial Bonuses will be used as written in the 5e Players handbook (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/races\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/races\" target=\"_self\">Racial Ability Score Increases – D&amp;D Basic Rules</a>)We will not be strictly using encumbrance, but I will likely slow you down some if you start carrying around something which is obviously going to slow you down...We will be using the formula (2 x dice) + mod. Will depending on narrative cause a fumble which may, harm you or someone else you didn't intend, drop a weapon... things like this. I won't be breaking weapons etc. on you. The DM may award Inspiration for exceptional role playing, meaningful character driven choices, or moments that strongly reflect a character’s values.Inspiration can be spent to gain advantage on a single roll and does not stack. For most situations, up to two different characters may attempt the same skill check. Alternatively, one character may take the lead while another provides help, granting advantage on the roll.For group checks, everyone involved will roll. The lowest roll is discarded (when 6+ players are rolling), and the majority result will generally determine the outcome, adjusted as needed for the narrative situation.We use standard 5e resting rules. A short rest is at least 1 hour of downtime during which you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points. A long rest is at least 8 hours of rest including sleep. After a long rest you regain all hit points and some Hit Dice back. You can benefit from only one long rest per 24 hours.<br>\nFor full details see the official Basic Rules: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\"

Engagement is more important than strict silence, and collaborative moments are encouraged.Phones and devices are welcome at the table and are expected to be used primarily for character sheets, rules reference, and notes. If an important call or message comes in, it is completely fine to step away briefly to take it.Please be mindful of shared spotlight time and give others space to contribute. If something is unclear or not working for you, speak up. This is a cooperative game, and we will adjust as needed.\nFood will be allowed at the table. If you have any allergies that we don't know about now would be a great time to mention it.\nAlcohol will be allowed at the table, you are your own liquor control board, no drinking and driving.\nLet's Discuss:\nHow much narrative control players have (I'm very much interested in players adding to the story).\nTake backs, or retconning, will be permitted when...\n● the DM misrepresents a scene or creature, rule.\n● a player describes their character’s actions as an obvious joke.\n● the player has not completed their turn\nDiscuss: Player-vs-player action is acceptable...\n❏ during social interactions\n❏ during combat\n❏ never\n❏\nDiscuss any RPG pet peeves that have not yet been addressed\nDiscuss the “rating” of your typical game: G, PG, PG-13, R, X. I expect given the players at this table the rating will be at times R rated. If there is any topic you want to keep out of the game please let me know either in session or privately I have no problem adding hard rules about anything that makes anyone uncomfortable. This campaign is to have fun to make anyone uncomfortable. I want you all to feel that you can provide feedback, however I would like to keep it primarily out of play sessions as I would like to make this as immersive a campaign as I can muster for you all, this can be done through discussion at the beginning or end of a session, or via text, that said questions about game mechanics etc. are welcome anytime I know we have some new players.Does anyone have any questions or concerns about anything we discussed today?

Overview","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Assets/Public/averwyn.png\" src=\"assets/public/averwyn.png\" target=\"_self\">This campaign is set in Averwyn, a settled and civilized land where roads are maintained, trade flows steadily, and laws provide structure to daily life. For most people, Averwyn feels predictable, orderly, and safe. Communities are stable. Institutions function. Problems are expected to be handled properly.You will begin as ordinary adventurers, not legends or chosen heroes. Your early experiences will be grounded and local. Small jobs, personal requests, and practical concerns will shape your first steps into the world.Averwyn favors structure and process. When disputes arise, there are rules for resolving them. When authority is involved, it is typically calm, professional, and confident in its procedures. This creates a sense of reliability, though not every decision feels personal, and not every outcome feels entirely satisfying.The campaign emphasizes people, choices, and consequences rather than constant combat. Violence exists, but it is not always the best or easiest solution. Conversations, investigations, and judgment calls often matter just as much as swords and spells.As you travel through Averwyn and interact with its people, you may begin to notice patterns. Customs that are widely accepted. Rules that seem reasonable in isolation. Outcomes that do not affect everyone equally. What those patterns mean, and how much they matter, is something your characters will discover through play.There is no single expected path. You may pursue personal goals, take on responsibility, seek influence, or simply try to live well within the world as it is. The story will respond to what you engage with and what you choose to leave untouched.This is a character driven campaign. Your backgrounds, values, and reactions will shape how Averwyn responds to you. The tone is grounded, sometimes warm, sometimes tense, and always shaped by consequence.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"assets/public/averwyn.png","fullURL":"player/world-and-story-overview.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["assets/public/averwyn.html"],"createdTime":1768189366915,"modifiedTime":1768190146932,"sourceSize":1969,"sourcePath":"Player/World and Story Overview.md","exportPath":"player/world-and-story-overview.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":24,"backlinks":["player/sessions/session-0.html"],"type":"markdown"},"assets/public/averwyn.html":{"title":"averwyn","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"assets/public/averwyn.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"assets/public/averwyn.png","fullURL":"assets/public/averwyn.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["assets/public/averwyn.html"],"createdTime":1768190096824,"modifiedTime":1768190097228,"sourceSize":2976295,"sourcePath":"Assets/Public/averwyn.png","exportPath":"assets/public/averwyn.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["player/world-and-story-overview.html"],"type":"attachment"},"player/rules/alignment.html":{"title":"Alignment","icon":"","description":"Alignment is a tool to help describe a character’s values and instincts.
